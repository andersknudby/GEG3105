        "#Chapter 4 - Functions\r\n",
        "As you start to write more complicated code, it will often happen that you need to do the same thing several times. If this thing is complicated and requires more than a few lines of code, like reading a satellite image, reprojecting a shapefile, or extracting values from a raster at the locations of points in a shapefile, it would make your brain explode (and make your code very difficult to read through and understand) if you had to write all the necessary code in you program each time you had to do that complicated thing. This is what functions are for. Functions let you write a sequence of commands that you will be using over and over, and pack them together such that they can be used with a single command instead. It's like 'putting your pants on', which you can express with a single statement even though it actually takes a sequence of individual steps (find you pants, grab the right opening, put one leg in, put the other leg in, pull them up, zip and/or button them up). Functions let you hide all the details so you don't have to think of them every time you want to 'put your pants on'. Functions are your friends â€“ learning to write and make good use of functions will be one of the most important parts of making you an effective programmer.\r\n",

        "* The definition of a new function uses the keyword 'def', followed by the name you want to give your function (please always name it something meaningful!), followed by the input(s) required in brackets. In programming speak, those inputs are called 'arguments'. In the function above I have called the argument 'input' and not 'array' because this function can actually calculate the mean value of both arrays and lists (assuming, of course, that the lists are full of numbers!). Following the 'def' statement, all lines that make up the function are indented.\r\n",
        "* np.sum() is used to calculate the sum of the values in 'input'. Nothing exciting to see here.\r\n",
        "* len() is used to calculate the number of values in 'input'. Not exciting either, but very useful!\r\n",
        "* When dividing the 'sum' by the 'number', we make sure to convert one of them (it doesn't matter which one) to a float, to avoid problems associated with integer division.\r\n",
        "* Finally, the keyword 'return' is used to send a result back from the function, either to be printed in the output window (if the function is used directly from the Python Interpreter) or to be put in a variable (if run in an executed piece of code). You can easily return more than one variable from a function (e.g. just write 'return mean, sum' if you want to return both variables).\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Once you have written the lines above in the text editor window, you need to execute them for the Python Interpreter to be aware of your new function. The easiest way of doing that is to always write your functions at the top of your .py document. When the lines that comprise the function are executed, nothing happens except that the Python Interpreter learns what your function is called and what it does. The function is only put to use when it is specifically called outside the 'def' statement.\r\n",

You can then expand the code in each function if you want to look at it in more detail, but once you are satisfied that it works and you don't need to see the details all the time, you can turn it into a single line. PyScripter does not have code folding, which is a major shortcoming for using it to build large pieces of code. So using PyScripter you will always have your own functions displayed with every single line of code at the top of your .py file.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That's really all there is to functions. Python libraries like NumPy are basically a collection of functions that serve a particular purpose and work well together. You'll recognize functions by the brackets '()' the follow the function name, as in 'np.mean()', 'len()', or your own 'myMean()'. Note that is it perfectly fine to use functions within other functions, as you did yourself in myMean(). Using functions within functions is actually very useful, because it allows you to build smaller functions that do small generic things (like calculating an average), and then use them in larger functions that do more specific things (like calculating an average of values in a field from a shapefile).\r\n"
